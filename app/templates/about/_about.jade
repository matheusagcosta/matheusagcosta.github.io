        | Think. Test. Repeat.
      p Creativity has been part of my life since I was a little kid, drawing dogs and spaceships on paper.
      p Shifting to the web, I could learn the concept of iteration and how things could constantly be improved by getting feedback.
      p Software is the medium through which it's possible to make the digital world more human.
      p As a multidisciplinary designer and systems thinker, I aim to speak machine, not code, and translate that to the best user experience, where communication is the key to making our lives easier.
