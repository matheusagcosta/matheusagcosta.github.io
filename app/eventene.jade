      | #{''} is an event management system for creating, organizing and running events in a single platform.
    p.project__text It was a startup with 5 team members (at the time) looking for their space in the business.
    p.project__text As a full remote team we had our weekly calls and additional design meetings to discuss what’s working or not.
    p.project__text Since we were small, to prioritize things the CEO talked to customers and gave us their feedback about the current product and new things coming.

    h3.project__subheading The Problem
    p.project__text Their product was amazing, it had a lot of features but some of them were hard to discover and implement.
    p.project__text Part of that is beacuse the company didn’t know any Design Principles. So I had a very long journey from throwing everything away and starting over.
    p.project__text To begin the process I had to perform a small branding update, bringing modern color shades and applying gradients to stand out a bit more and giving a fresh look to the product.

    p.project__text Internally each Eventene application has an animal codename. So Bobcat stands to the main app since it’s robust and the bigger one, Falcon goes to the mobile app because it’s small and fast and Unicorn is the best to describe the design elements for being a lengedary creature and its relationship to fantasy.

  .project__block
    p.project__text In our model we had a slight difference through the steps, keeping the pages as templates so wireframes are only visible for designers, that way we could remove the friction for developers.
    p.project__text We also created a closer language by using the unicorn paradigm so the team can find which piece of the animal is missing associating that with the UI component.

    p.project__text Having that in mind we decided to use Figma to create the basic variation of each atomic level and then document and specify them in a static page.
    p.project__text Another reason to do that is to see all components behaving properly, since design tools are limited and not 100% responsive.
